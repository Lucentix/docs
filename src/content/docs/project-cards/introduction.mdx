This project is a digital adaptation of **Fortoga’s** humorous card game.  
The development is being carried out by **Lucentix & cuzimstupi4**, with the goal of making the game playable on PC, tablet, and smartphone.

## Project Goals

- Create a functional digital version of the game.  
- Enable private rounds, with public matches planned for later.  
- Implement a point system and voting mechanism.  
- Ensure expandability for future features.  

The first version will provide a playable foundation – design enhancements and additional features will come later.
